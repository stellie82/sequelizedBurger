# Burger Bucket List

This application allows users to input names of burgers they wish to eat.  A user will be able to add the name of a burger of interest to a list.  Once the user has tried the burger, they can then click on the "Devour" button to move it over to a _done_ list.  Each burger on either list will be stored in a database using MySQL.
